It feels great! Such a wonderful day!Even though it is a wasteland, I still think I can survive.I am born to be a strong and wonderful man.
What a great day.I feels alive.I guess God is with me. I am smart and delightful.
I have done so many things today. A lot of great progress! I feel like I can do everything.
I will pray for the next day! God please bless me, tomorrow is still a good day.
I will conquer the island. I am the KING of the island!
Good night to myself. Tomorrrow is another sunny, good day!
