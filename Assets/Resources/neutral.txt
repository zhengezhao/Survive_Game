It may be okay.
Just another work.
Not too much.
I hope it works.
This will be a long day.
Am I the last one survived from the shipwreck? I dont know.
I guess this is the correct way.
Maybe I will be found by some ships tomorrow.
At this time, I need some food.
At this time, I need some drinks.
I need to finish the work before the sunset.
Anyone lived here before? I am not sure.
I am not sure what is in front of me, maybe I have to spend rest of my life here.
I need to start a firebone to avoid animal attack.
